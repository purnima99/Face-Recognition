# Face-Recognition

Face Recognition in a live webcam feed or an image using OpenCV, Python and Deep Learning

To run this -
* Create a python environment with all dependencies installed (tensorflow, keras, opencv, numpy & python).
* Activate the environment.
* For face recognition in images - type and run 'python image.py' on the terminal.
* For face recognition in videos - type and run 'python video.py' on the terminal.

Tech Stack -
* Used MTCNN for face detection, OpenCV for encodings and Triplet loss for training.
* Used FaceNet Model for face identification.
* Classification using tensorflowâ€™s keras.model
